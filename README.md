I'm on a journey to become my best self.

Ever since I realised a few years ago that high job titles aren't for old or priviledged people, I started to look higher than the average. VP, CTO, CISO, all these suddenly became a possiblity.

I'm not necessarily declaring that I'm going to be a CTO in a number of years, I don't even know I really want to become one. But I will focus a lot more on opportunities and get myself outside of my comfort zone.

My journey right now is to be the best manager I can be.
